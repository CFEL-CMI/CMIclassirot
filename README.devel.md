# Development guidelines

Please follow some simple rules for coding on CMIclassirot:

* keep the code consistent across the whole package!
* Document all code and adjust comments before you change the code to reflect
  and discuss, even if only with yourself, the planned changes.
* use git-flow (possibly the tools and especially the concept)
* consistently use two empty lines between functions/methods and three empty
  lines above a class


## Developer install

pip install --editable .
